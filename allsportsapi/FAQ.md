<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>How to get live and pre-match data from the API?</h3>

<p>If you're seeking live and pre-match data, such as statistics, you will have to interact with specific API endpoints labeled with "Match". These can be conveniently located on the RapidAPI page.</p> 

<p>Using the built-in search tool within the endpoints tab on RapidAPI, you can simply type 'Match'. This will instantly return a comprehensive list of all related endpoints, including data categories like statistics, incidents, odds, and more. This efficient method will help you quickly find the necessary endpoints for retrieving the data you need.</p>
<h3>How to Retrieve Player Statistics from a Match?</h3>

<p>There are two primary methods to access player statistics. The first method involves using the 'Match Lineups' endpoint, for example: 'Football Match Lineups'. This endpoint provides comprehensive data about all participating players, inclusive of their respective statistics.</p>

<p>The second approach utilizes the 'Match Player Statistics' endpoint. By inputting a specific player's id, you can directly retrieve that player's statistics. Both methods can be accessed effortlessly through the search tool in the endpoints tab on the RapidAPI page.</p>
<h3>Methods for Displaying Images on Your Website</h3>

<p>All image or logo endpoints return responses in image/png format, with placeholders being the only exception, which return SVG images. To integrate these images on your website, considering the necessary authorization headers for the API calls, you have several practical options:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fetch API:</strong> Use JavaScript's Fetch API or other similar HTTP libraries like Axios to send a GET request to the endpoint. Then, set the response as a source for an HTML img element. The Fetch API allows for the setting of specific headers, accommodating the need for authorization.</li>

<li><strong>Base64 Conversion:</strong> Convert the image to a base64 string using JavaScript after making an authorized fetch request. This allows for dynamic rendering of the image on your website.</li>

<li><strong>Server-side Proxy:</strong> Implement a server-side proxy that handles the authenticated request to the API, retrieves the image, and then serves it to the front-end of your website. This approach isolates the API credentials on the server, improving security.</li>

<li><strong>Canvas API:</strong> Another dynamic approach, especially useful when needing to manipulate images further, is to use JavaScript's Canvas API. Fetch the image via an authorized request, then draw it onto a canvas element.</li>

</ol>

<p>Each method has its own benefits, so choose the one that best aligns with your website's requirements and your comfort with JavaScript and server-side programming.</p>

<h3>Determining the Match Time</h3>

<p>When you interact with any match endpoint, we provide an array of detailed information. Among these, the attribute "statusTime" is vital to determining the match's ongoing time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"statusTime"</strong>: Contains data about the current time of the match. With this information, you can perform simple mathematical operations to calculate the seconds that have passed since the beginning of the period. Specifically, the current time is calculated as: (current timestamp - event["statusTime"]["timestamp"]) + event["statusTime"]["initial"].</li>
</ul>

<p>If you aim to implement the time in a "time + added time" format, the current added time after the official period (e.g., the standard 45 minutes for football/soccer), would follow the below logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If (current timestamp - event["statusTime"]["timestamp"]) > event["statusTime"]["max"], then the added time would be: (current timestamp - event["statusTime"]["timestamp"]) - event["statusTime"]["max"].</li>
</ul>

<p>We also offer an attribute called "time" which encompasses "injuryTime" - the maximum additional time granted by the referee, also known as injury time.</p>

<p>Please note, all timestamps we provide are in seconds.</p>

<h4>Incidents</h4>

<p>Descriptions of incidents can be extracted through the "incidentType", "incidentClass", or "text" attributes. Here's a breakdown of their possible values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>incidentType:</strong> Can be "period", "penaltyShootout", "card", "substitution", "injuryTime", "goal", "varDecision", "inGamePenalty".</li>
  <li><strong>incidentClass:</strong> Various values depending on the incident type, such as:
    <ul>

      <li>For "card": "red", "yellow", "yellowRed".</li>
      <li>For "goal": "penalty", "regular", "ownGoal".</li>
      <li>For "substitution": "injury", null.</li>
      <li>For "varDecision": "penaltyNotAwarded", "goalAwarded", "cardUpgrade", with a subsequent 'confirmed' attribute that could be true or false.</li>
      <li>For "inGamePenalty": "missed".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>text:</strong> Specific to "period", can be "HT", "FT", "ET", "PEN".</li>
</ul>

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>The status of the match is described using two properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>type:</strong> Provides a code string to represent the match status. Possible returns are: 'inprogress', 'finished', 'postponed', 'interrupted', 'canceled', 'notstartedâ€™.</li>
  <li><strong>description:</strong> Offers a more understandable text of the status. For football, this can include '1st half', '2nd half', 'Halftime', 'Ended', 'Postponed', 'Canceled', 'Not started', "AP" (After Penalties), "AET" (After Extra Time), "1st extra", "Extra time halftime", "2nd extra", "Awaiting penalties", "Penalties", "Awaiting extra time".</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to get all leagues of the sport?</h3>

<p>In order to retrieve all the leagues of a particular sport, it's necessary to list all categories first, and then subsequently list all the tournaments within each category. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>List all Categories:</strong> Categories essentially represent the country, tour, or game of the tournaments. Start by fetching all categories via the endpoints: <code>/api/tournament/categories</code> for football, or <code>/api/{sport}/tournament/categories</code> for other sports, where <code>{sport}</code> is a placeholder for the sport in question.</li>
    <li><strong>List all Tournaments within each Category:</strong> Upon obtaining a response, you can then proceed to fetch all leagues within each category using the endpoint: <code>/api/tournament/all/category/{category_id}</code> for football, or <code>/api/{sport}/tournament/all/category/{category_id}</code> for other sports, with <code>{category_id}</code> being the ID of a specific category.</li>
    <li><strong>Get Schedules for each Category:</strong> There is an additional functionality that allows you to see events scheduled for a certain day for each category. Use the endpoint: <code>/api/category/{category_id}/events/{day}/{month}/{year}</code> for football, or <code>/api/{sport}/category/{category_id}/events/{day}/{month}/{year}</code> for other sports. Here, <code>{day}</code>, <code>{month}</code>, and <code>{year}</code> are placeholders for the specific day you want to check, with <code>{day}</code> being an integer value.</li>
</ol>

<p>This way, you can obtain a comprehensive list of leagues and their respective events for any sport. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, our team is always ready to assist you.</p>
<h3>Retrieving All Teams in a League</h3>

<p>For obtaining a comprehensive list of all the teams in a specific league, you'll be using our 'standings' endpoints. The process involves:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Standings Endpoint:</strong> The standings endpoint is the go-to resource for retrieving data about all teams within a particular league. It provides an array of team data including their current standings, wins, losses, draws, goal difference, and more.</li>
</ol>

<p>By calling the standings endpoint, you can acquire a detailed snapshot of the teams participating in your selected league, providing a robust foundation for creating rich, interactive experiences around league data.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Schedule Endpoints Returning Matches from Previous and Next Day</h3>

<p>The schedules endpoint is designed to cater to users across various time zones. Thus, to ensure all time zones are covered, we return matches that span 12 hours of the previous day and 12 hours of the next day, relative to GMT/UTC+00. This approach allows us to provide match data that is relevant to users, regardless of their geographical location.</p>

<p>Here's a quick summary from a relevant <a href="https://rapidapi.com/fluis.lacasse/api/allsportsapi2/discussions/38225" target="_blank">discussion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, the endpoint returns matches independent of the userâ€™s timezone. You can filter the matches according to your timezone. If you need help doing so, we can assist you.</blockquote>

<p>For a more detailed explanation, please refer to this <a href="https://rapidapi.com/fluis.lacasse/api/footapi7/discussions/33473" target="_blank">discussion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The matches returned by the schedules endpoint are timestamped according to the GMT/UTC+00 timezone. Therefore, to cover all time zones, matches from 12 hours of the previous day and 12 hours of the next day are included in the response.</blockquote>

<p>Don't hesitate to reach out if you require any further clarification or assistance in filtering matches according to your specific timezone. Our team is here to help!</p>
<h3>What If the Data I Need Isn't Available?</h3>

<p>If you find that the data you're looking for isn't provided by this API, we suggest exploring another API that may better cater to your requirements. We recommend you to consider checking out the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/fluis.lacasse/api/allscores/" target="_blank">Allscores</a> API. </p>

<h3>Understanding Team Transfer Types</h3>

<p>In team transfers, we categorize transfer activities into three types, each representing a different kind of transaction:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Type 1:</strong> This represents a loan transfer. In this type of transfer, a player is temporarily moved from their current team to another team for a specified period.</li>

<li><strong>Type 2:</strong> This represents the end of a loan period. At the conclusion of the loan period, the player returns to their original team from the team to which they were loaned.</li>

<li><strong>Type 3:</strong> This type indicates a permanent transfer where a player is bought or sold between teams. The player permanently changes their team affiliation in these transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These categories allow you to understand the dynamics of team transfers and the nature of the movement of players between teams.</p>
